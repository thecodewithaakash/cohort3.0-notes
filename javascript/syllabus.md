# 🦄Syllabus for JavaScript

---

## Phase 1 — Foundations

**Goal:** Get comfortable writing JavaScript. Stop being scared of the syntax.

**Topics:**

- What is JavaScript? History, where it runs (browser, Node.js), why it matters
- Setting up the environment — browser DevTools, VS Code, Node.js installation
- Your first program — `console.log` and other console methods (`warn`, `error`, `table`)
- Comments — single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* */`)
- Variables — `var`, `let`, `const` (basic introduction; deeper differences come in Phase 3)
- Naming conventions and rules for identifiers
- Data types — primitive vs non-primitive
    - Primitive: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, `bigint`
    - Non-primitive: `object` (intro only)
- The `typeof` operator
- Type conversion vs type coercion (implicit vs explicit)
- Operators
    - Arithmetic: `+`, , , `/`, `%`, , `++`,
    - Assignment: `=`, `+=`, `=`, `=`, `/=`
    - Comparison: `==` vs `===`, `!=` vs `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
    - Logical: `&&`, `||`, `!`
    - Ternary operator (`condition ? a : b`)
- String basics — concatenation, template literals (intro), common methods (`length`, `toUpperCase`, `toLowerCase`, `slice`, `substring`, `indexOf`, `includes`, `split`, `trim`, `replace`)
- Number basics — `toFixed`, `parseInt`, `parseFloat`, `Number()`, `isNaN`, the `Math` object
- Conditionals — `if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`
- Loops — `for`, `while`, `do...while`, `for...of`, `for...in` (brief)
- `break` and `continue`
- Taking user input — `prompt()` in the browser

**End-of-phase mini projects:** Calculator, temperature converter, FizzBuzz, simple guessing game.

## Phase 2 — Functions, Arrays & Objects

**Goal:** Learn how to organize logic and data. This is where you start writing "real" programs.

**Topics:**

**Functions**

- Function declaration vs function expression
- Anonymous functions
- Arrow functions — full syntax, shorthand, implicit return
- Parameters vs arguments
- Default parameters
- Rest parameters (`...args`)
- Return values (single return, early return)
- Functions as first-class citizens — passing functions, returning functions
- IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) — what and why
- Callback functions — introduction
- Higher-order functions — introduction
- Pure vs impure functions
- Recursion basics

**Arrays**

- Creating arrays, accessing elements, array length
- Mutating vs non-mutating methods
- Common methods: `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, `slice`, `splice`, `concat`, `indexOf`, `includes`, `join`, `reverse`, `sort`
- Iteration methods: `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `find`, `findIndex`, `some`, `every`
- Array destructuring
- Spread and rest with arrays
- Multi-dimensional arrays

**Objects**

- Creating objects using object literals
- Accessing properties — dot vs bracket notation
- Adding, updating, deleting properties
- Methods (functions inside objects)
- Nested objects
- Object destructuring (basic and renaming/defaults)
- Spread with objects
- `Object.keys`, `Object.values`, `Object.entries`
- `Object.assign`, `Object.freeze`, `Object.seal`
- Looping through objects

**End-of-phase mini projects:** To-do list (in-memory), student grade tracker, shopping cart logic, word frequency counter.

## Phase 3 — The HOW Begins (Where You Shine)

**Goal:** Understand what is actually happening when JavaScript runs your code. This is the phase that separates good developers from average ones.

**Topics:**

- How JavaScript works under the hood — single-threaded, synchronous, interpreted/JIT-compiled
- JavaScript engines — V8 (Chrome, Node), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), JavaScriptCore (Safari)
- **Execution Context**
    - What is an Execution Context?
    - Global Execution Context (GEC)
    - Function Execution Context (FEC)
    - Two phases: Creation phase (Memory) and Execution phase (Code)
- **Call Stack**
    - How JavaScript tracks function calls
    - Visualizing the call stack
    - Stack overflow — what causes it
- **Hoisting**
    - `var` hoisting (initialized as `undefined`)
    - `let` and `const` hoisting — Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
    - Function declarations vs function expressions — hoisting differences
- **Scope**
    - Global scope
    - Function scope
    - Block scope
    - Lexical scope — what does "lexical" really mean?
- **Scope chain** — how JS looks up variables
- **Closures**
    - What is a closure (the real definition)
    - Step-by-step trace of how closures work
    - Practical use cases — data privacy, function factories, counters, currying
    - Common closure interview questions
    - Closure + loop classic problem (and why `let` solves it)

**Recommended:** Pause and revisit Phase 1 and 2 examples with this new lens. The "aha" moments here are what make this phase special.

## Phase 4 — Objects Deeper & `this`

**Goal:** Understand JavaScript's object model — how inheritance really works, and why `this` confuses everyone.

**Topics:**

- **The `this` keyword**
    - `this` in the global scope (browser vs Node)
    - `this` in regular functions
    - `this` in methods
    - `this` in arrow functions (lexical `this`)
    - `this` in event handlers
    - `this` in `setTimeout` / `setInterval`
    - `this` in strict mode
- **`call`, `apply`, `bind`** — explicit binding of `this`
- **Prototypes**
    - What is a prototype?
    - `__proto__` vs `prototype` (the most confusing pair in JS, explained)
    - Prototype chain
    - `Object.create`
    - Inheritance via prototypes
- **Constructor functions**
    - Using `new` keyword
    - What `new` does behind the scenes (4 steps)
- **ES6 Classes**
    - `class` syntax
    - `constructor`
    - Instance methods
    - Inheritance with `extends` and `super`
    - Static methods and static properties
    - Getters and setters
    - Private fields (`#`)
    - **Big reveal:** Classes are syntactic sugar over prototypes — proof by example

## Phase 5 — Asynchronous JavaScript

**Topics:**

- Synchronous vs Asynchronous — what's the difference and why we need async
- **Callbacks**
    - `setTimeout`, `setInterval`
    - `clearTimeout`, `clearInterval`
    - Callback patterns
    - Callback hell (pyramid of doom) — the problem
- **Promises**
    - What is a Promise?
    - States: `pending`, `fulfilled`, `rejected`
    - Creating promises with `new Promise`
    - Consuming promises — `.then`, `.catch`, `.finally`
    - Promise chaining
    - Error propagation in chains
    - `Promise.all`, `Promise.race`, `Promise.allSettled`, `Promise.any`
- **async / await**
    - Syntax and rules
    - Error handling with `try`/`catch`
    - Sequential vs parallel execution
    - Common mistakes (forgetting `await`, missing `try/catch`)

- Destructuring (advanced patterns, nested, with defaults)
- Spread and rest (advanced use cases)
- Template literals — tagged templates
- Optional chaining (`?.`)
- Nullish coalescing (`??`)
- Short-circuit evaluation patterns (`&&`, `||` as control flow)
- Logical assignment operators (`??=`, `||=`, `&&=`)

**Modules**

- ES Modules — `import` / `export` (named exports, default exports, re-exports)
- Brief mention of CommonJS (`require`, `module.exports`) for Node context
- Dynamic imports

**Error handling**

- `try`, `catch`, `finally`
- `throw`
- Built-in error types (`Error`, `TypeError`, `ReferenceError`, etc.)
- Creating custom error classes

**Useful built-ins**

- `Map` and `Set` (and `WeakMap`, `WeakSet` briefly)
- `Date` object
- Regular expressions (basics — patterns, flags, common methods)
- Iterators and generators (introduction)

**Storage and persistence**

- `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`
- Cookies (brief)

**Best practices**

- Writing clean, readable code
- Naming conventions
- Avoiding common pitfalls
- Debugging with DevTools — breakpoints, watch, call stack inspection
- Reading and understanding error messages

**Optional bridge topics (based on time):**

- DOM manipulation basics — selecting, modifying, events
- Event delegation and bubbling

**Capstone project ideas:** Weather app using Fetch API, expense tracker with localStorage, quiz app, simple Kanban board.

## How to Use This Syllabus

- **Don't rush.** Each phase has a reason for its position. Skipping ahead means you'll be confused later.
- **Code along.** Watching is not learning. Type every example yourself.
- **Revisit.** After Phase 3, go back to Phase 1 examples. After Phase 5, revisit Phase 2. You'll see them with new eyes.
- **Build the projects.** They tie the concepts together.
- **Ask questions.** If something doesn't click, it's almost always because of a missing piece from an earlier phase — find it.

By the end of this course, you won't just *know* JavaScript. You'll *understand* it.
